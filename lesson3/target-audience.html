		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>The target audience for Wind and Sky Weather are the residents of Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven, Idaho, and those traveling to or through them. The site will report a forecast, to help the residents prepare for the days ahead- rain, snow, or shine. Both males and females ranging from 18-65 years old are included in the target audience. People under the age of 18 years may rely on their parents for their weather information and preparation, and those older than 65 tend to rely on other, more traditional avenues to get their weather forcasts. </p>

		<h2>Personas</h2>
		<p>Persona 1: The Business Woman
			<br>
			This woman is busy, running from her house to her full-time job. She has to dress professionally, despite the weather, and needs to be in the loop on what the day will look like so she can plan accordingly. 
		</p>
		<p>Persona 2: The College Student.
			<br>
			This student is worried about school work, heading to the library, and making it to classes. They need to know if they have to plan extra time before classes for scraping snow off their car and heating their car up. They also need to know what shoes are appropriate for the day, as they will be walking around their college campus.

		<h2>Scenarios</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The young man is on his way to his job interview and needs to bring his resume. If it were any normal sunny day, he wouldn't worry about putting it in a folder and would just carry it in with him. However, he knows that the weather can always be changing, so he looks on our site for confirmation about what they day will hold. Seeing that it may rain, he finds a waterproof folder to carry his resume in, so the paper won't get wet.</li>
			<li>A mom is planning on walking her kids to school, but isn't sure if they'll need rainboots, snowboots, or everyday shoes. She checks Wind and Sky Weather for a forcast so she can plan accordingly. </li>
			<li>One man is off to a big business meeting in the next town over. However, he knows there can be traffic from time to time on that drive. He checks Wind and Sky Weather the night before he commutes, so he can know just how much time to plan for driving in case there is snow or potential dangerous driving conditions.</li>
			<li>A college student is going on a date that night. She doesn't know if it will be cold, snowing, raining, or just a good, clear night. She wants to dress up all cute, and wants to plan her outfit. She checks Wind and Sky Weather and finds out that she may need a snow coat afterall, so she wears something that matches with her coat.</li>
			<li>A church leader is getting all ready for the big barbeque at the park, when someone says, "It always rains when we try to do events. I bet we'll have to postpone." The church leader looks at our weather report, and sees that there are clear skies with a small chance of rain, so she borrows a tarp from a member and sets it up over the food and eating area. The event is saved.</li>
